# Security Policy

## Introduction

Security issues happen as part of the normal lifecycle of software development.

## Supported Versions

Only latest major version is supported, including last 5 minor versions. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Anyone finding an issue that is already publicly disclosed (for example, a CVE in one of the projectâ€™s dependencies) should feel free to create an issue and discuss openly on GitHub. The process below is only intended for issues that have not been publicly disclosed yet.

Any not publicly disclosed should be opened via security advisory.
